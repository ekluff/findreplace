By Evan Clough

Description

A simple web application that allows a user to input a phrase, a word they want to replace, and a word with which they want to replace it. The word to be replaced is case sensitive. The functionality also replaces words that are in other words, so be careful when replacing words like "the" because it will be replaced in "there".

Setup

_Open index.html in the root folder in a web browser.

Technologies Used

Written in javascript & jQuery
Frontend with html5, css, and bootstrap
